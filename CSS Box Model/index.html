            <h1>Cascading Style Sheets</h1>
            <p>
                CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation and styling
                of a
                document written in a markup language like HTML or XML. It controls how webpages look in a browser by
                applying style
                declarations to selected elements. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, working
                alongside
                HTML and
                JavaScript

        <h2><b>Key aspects of CSS</b></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b><i>Styling HTML elements:</i></b>
                <p>
                    CSS primarily styles HTML elements, but it can also be used with other markup languages like SVG or
                    XML.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b><i>Cascading rules:</i></b>
                <p>
                    The "cascading" in CSS refers to the rules that determine how selectors are prioritized to apply
                    styles,
                    which is crucial for complex websites with many rules.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b><i>Declarative language:</i></b>
                <p>
                    CSS is declarative, meaning it describes what the style should look like rather than how to achieve
                    it,
                    leaving the browser to handle the rendering process.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b><i>Separation of concerns:</i></b>
                <p>
                    CSS promotes separating the structure (HTML) from the presentation (CSS), making websites more
                    maintainable
                    and accessible.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b><i>Different ways to apply CSS:</i></b>
                <p>
                    CSS can be applied through external stylesheets (most common and best practice), internal
                    stylesheets
                    (within the HTML document), or inline styles (directly on HTML elements)
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

            In essence, CSS is the language that adds visual flair and design to the structure of a webpage, much like
            adding decorations and colors to a house
