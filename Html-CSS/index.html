        <h1>EndeavourOS</h1>
        <p>
            EndeavourOS is an Arch Linux-based Linux distribution. EndeavourOS began as a successor to Antergos, a
            discontinued
            distribution also based on Arch Linux.[2][3] It uses the
            same rolling release schedule as Arch Linux, but periodically releases updated installation media (ISO
            files).
            As of
            February 10, 2025, the most recent release is "Endeavour Mercury"

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            EndeavourOS began as a continuation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antergos">Antergos</a>
            Linux
            distribution, a distribution itself based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_Linux">Arch
                Linux</a>, a
            general-purpose Linux distribution. In May 2019, Antergos' developers abruptly announced that development on
            the
            project would cease; a moderator of Antergos' forums discussed the idea of maintaining the community on a
            new
            forum. The idea received support from within the community, and within a day other Antergos moderators
            joined
            the
            project. Development on EndeavourOS quickly began, with the team planning to create a distribution that
            would be
            close to Arch Linux with the convenience of a GUI installer, while leaving GUI Pacman wrappers such as Pamac
            from
            the
            out-of-box installation. The first release was in July 2019.
