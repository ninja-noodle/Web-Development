    <h1>Obsolescence</h1>
    <p>
        <b>
            Obsolescence
        </b>
        is the process of becoming antiquated, out of date, old-fashioned, no longer in general use, or no longer
        useful, or
        the
        condition of being in such a state.
    </p>
    <h2>Consequences</h2>
    <p>
        Driven by rapid technological changes, new components are developed and
        launched on the market with increasing speed.
        The result is a dramatic change in production methods of all components and
        their market availability. A growing industry sector is facing issues where life cycles of products no longer
        fit
        together with life cycles of required components. This issue is known as obsolescence, the status given to a
        part
        when it is no longer available from its original manufacturer.
    </p>

    <p>
        The problem of obsolescence is most prevalent for electronics technology, wherein the procurement lifetimes for
        microelectronic parts are often significantly shorter than the manufacturing and support life cycles for the
        products that use the parts.
